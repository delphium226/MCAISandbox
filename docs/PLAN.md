# Implementation plan

The working plan for the real-Minecraft village agents, carried across coding sessions. CLAUDE.md says how to run
and test things and what earlier sessions learned; this file says **what to do next, why, and how we know it is
done**. It changes as we learn: see "Keeping this plan honest" at the end.

## How to use this plan in a session

1. **Start:** read CLAUDE.md, then this file's "Next session starts with" and the current phase. Bring the stack up
   (CLAUDE.md, "Running and checking"). Check `git status` for uncommitted work left from the last session.
2. **Pick one step** (or a few small ones). Work only on that; note anything else you find in the findings log below,
   not in code.
3. **Test up the ladder** (cheapest first, stop at the first failure): typecheck → targeted test of the change →
   staged run (`scripts/stage_village.py`, scripted workers) → benchmark if a prompt changed (`scripts/bench/`) →
   model-driven village run (`scripts/watch_village.py`). Never edit server files while a run is going.
4. **Record:** tick the step, add a row to the run record, add findings and decisions with the date.
5. **Commit** the tested step (CRLF preserved; `git diff --stat` vs `git diff --ignore-cr-at-eol --stat`). Ask the
   user before pushing.
6. **End:** rewrite "Next session starts with" so the next session can begin without this one's context.

## Next session starts with

(written 2026-09-29 at the end of the fourth session: docs 1.6, atlas 2.1, tree felling 2.2, phase 2A planned)

- **Code:** everything committed on `tiered-brain-building`; origin has up to `aeb78dc`; local only (ask before
  pushing): `8e257f8` handover, `d63d314` README/ARCHITECTURE (1.6), `5c24e5b`, `7cc1f9d` atlas (2.1), `9494d3d`
  felling (2.2), `bd68f12` jump fix + Fell1 + phase 2A, and this handover. Working tree clean except `runs/`.
- **Running when this session ended:** Paper, the Ollama app, both pinned model servers, the agent server
  (`runs/2026-09-29/agentserver-fell2.log`), all background tasks of this Claude session: check ports 25565, 8766,
  11435, 11436 and `python scripts/ollama_exec.py status` first. No agents in the world.
- **Where things stand:** phase 1 done (1.6 docs in `d63d314`). Phase 2: 2.1 shared atlas done (F53; `mcAtlas.ts`,
  `mc/server/atlas.json`, `/api/atlas`, village map on the panel); 2.2 whole-tree felling done and confirmed in a
  model-driven run (Fell1: 3/3 built in 23.1 min, 1 log failure; F54-F57); 2.2b and 2.3-2.4 wait. **Next: phase 2A
  (village infrastructure, the user's requirements), starting with V.1 and V.2 together** as designed below; the
  user asked for them in a new session. Do not re-ask the design questions: the user chose fixed designs in code,
  a code-computed needs list, a staircase mine, and 2A before 2.3.
- **V.1 + V.2:** the design proposed to the user is written out under those steps in phase 2A (the user said to
  build it next session: confirm briefly, then build).
- **Testing notes from this session:** staged runs with felling need `MCAI_STALL_MIN=5` (a 30-cobblestone task
  with a pickaxe to make takes over 3 min); `stage_village.py` no longer stops on soft "cannot be gathered here"
  failures. New checks: `scripts/checks/atlas.py`, `scripts/checks/fell_trees.py`; `scripts/bench/atlasbench.mts`.
  The panel can be checked without a browser: headless Edge (`msedge --headless=new --screenshot=... --window-size=
  1300,1100 --virtual-time-budget=8000 http://127.0.0.1:8766/panel`), then read the PNG.
- Run logs: `runs/2026-09-29/` (atlas-check*, trees-check1-9, stageT1-T5, fell1, agentserver-*.log).
- **The user's standing preferences** (also in Claude's memory): teleport SausageOfDoom4 to the Mayor at the start
  of every run when online (the watchers do it); agent names Gus, Mayor, Worker1-4; commit tested batches, ask before
  pushing; never edit server files while a run is going (draft edits in the scratchpad, apply between runs); stop a
  run as soon as it is clearly lost; report findings from logs and the panel, not just outcomes; show the approach
  before changing code at the start of a new piece of work.

## Phase 1: reliability of the survival village (done 2026-09-29)

Goal (the user's): "two matching cottages and a meeting hall" succeeds from nothing 2-3 times in a row with no
restarts or manual help. Standard setup: Mayor + Worker1, Worker2; mayor and architect gpt-oss:120b-cloud,
executors qwen3:30b-instruct; workers' planner gpt-oss while iterating, qwen3.8:27b for the final runs.

- [x] 1.0 Material estimate, collect fails fast, stuck rescue, quiet mayor (`19b9b47`; see findings F1-F9).
- [x] 1.1 Fixes from the 4-worker runs (`b7908db`, partly tested; see the handover): code-posted steps run as written;
      gather tasks covered by storage are marked done; ungatherable soft tasks fail at once; completion declared by
      code when the mayor waits with everything built; dig retry; pickaxe fixes; rescue only when the failed action
      got nowhere; pathfinder CPU limits; `collect` avoids plots and water.
- [x] 1.2 **A site that fits** (F19, F21, F24-F25). `find_site` checks every centre on a height grid built once
      (prefix sums, sliding min/max), allows a height range of 4 before shrinking (prepare_site levels it), widens to
      112 blocks, then walks up to 2 legs of 40 blocks toward dry land, never leaving 96 blocks of the village.
      `plan_layout` tries narrow streets (2, margin 1), then lays out the largest set that fits when at least half do
      (the rest in `v.unplaced`, shown in the village summary); fewer than half is refused with the size the whole
      village needs. When the mayor's next `find_site` succeeds, code lays out the unplaced buildings there (the model
      managed it 1-2 times in 10). Laid-out plots (`v.layouts`) are kept off by site searches and later layouts;
      completion waits for unplaced buildings. The mayor's `move_to`/`explore` beyond 96 blocks of home (first plot,
      storage, or where it started: `memory.origin`) is refused or shortened. The architect's brief carries the site's
      room. Tested: find_site at Fourfold7's spot, from open water and forced legs; layouts on 12/14/9-block sites
      through the API; mayorbench; Tightfit1 (below).
- [x] 1.3 **Slow mayor start** (F29). Fourfold7's mayor answered its first plan with an empty (waiting) plan, which
      was accepted silently; with nothing laid out only the 3-minute stall review woke it. Now a mayor with nothing
      laid out that returns no steps gets `find_site` added by code (without a site) or is asked again after 10 s
      (with one), and every mayor wait is logged. Accept1: first plan at 0.1 min, layout at 1.7 min.
- [x] 1.4 Small items (the user confirmed the panel's simple mode reads well, 09-29). Done: `advance_time false` in `mcRules.ts` WORLD_RULES (11 rules checked at start, "always
      day" in the summary); `explore` walks to an x/z goal (F23: the estimated y made it report "no path ... stopped
      at" the spot it reached). Moved to the backlog: village log lines in plain words for the panel.
- [x] 1.5 **Acceptance runs**, counted as passed by the user on 09-29 (gpt-oss: Accept9-11 passed in a row; qwen3.8: Accept15 and Accept18 passed, with
      five failed runs between them, each on a code bug since fixed; see the handover): 3 model-driven runs in a row, 2 workers, gpt-oss worker planner, all three buildings
      built and the village declared complete, no manual help. Then 2 runs with qwen3.8:27b as the workers' planner.
      Record each in the run record.
- [x] 1.6 Docs. CLAUDE.md (lessons 21-28 of the adapter, the model-spill trap, test sites,
      `scripts/checks/`, `scripts/attach_village.py`, session-restart and Monitor practices; LAN access, `MC_API_HOST`
      and the whitelist were already there). README and ARCHITECTURE.md (`d63d314`, 2026-09-29): site search, layout,
      design limits, range, run-as-written, rescue, completion by code, spill check, checks; diagrams updated.
      **Phase 1 done.**

## Phase 2: shared village atlas (agreed 2026-09-28)

Idea (the user's): agents share a map of what they have seen, so they find resources others located and help find
sites. Code keeps and uses the atlas; models do not read it raw.

- [x] 2.1 **Record**: as bots move, summarise each chunk they have loaded (surface height and flatness, water,
      reachable logs by kind, exposed sand, stone, clay) with a timestamp, ~~in the village registry~~ in one shared
      atlas, `mc/server/atlas.json` (decision 09-29). Show it on the panel as one village map (simple mode too). Test:
      walk Gus around, check the saved summary against `/api/block`; measure the cost per chunk (target well under
      1 ms; CPU is shared by all bots). Done 09-29 (`mcAtlas.ts`, `/api/atlas`, `scripts/checks/atlas.py`; F53).
- [x] 2.2 **Finish trees** (replaces the atlas-guided collect here; decision 09-29, F54): `collect` fells a trunk
      it has started completely, like a player: pillar up beside or under it with dirt, cut each log in reach, then
      dig its own pillar back down (only the blocks it placed; the dirt comes back), so no floating trunk or pillar is
      left and the canopy decays by itself. One failure on a trunk marks the whole trunk, not one log. Dirt: carried,
      or dug beside the tree and put back. Test: Gus on tall oak and jungle trees (count logs left, pillar blocks
      left), then a staged full run; watch the "could not reach logs" count (39 of 61 were floating trunks).
      Done 09-29 (F55, F56): StageT5 built testhall + testhut in 13.0 min with no failures but soft sand ones.
- [ ] 2.2b **Gather from the atlas**: `collect` with nothing in view goes to the nearest atlas entry for the material
      (and fails fast if it is gone, updating the atlas). Low value while the view distance (8 chunks) covers the
      96-block range (F54); mainly a CPU saving. Test: staged full run on a site with sand out of view.
- [ ] 2.3 **Sites from it**: `find_site` scores candidates over the atlas: level, dry, and trees, stone and sand
      within reach. Test: staged runs in the places that went wrong (jungle hills at -560,-60; lake at -235,-53).
- [ ] 2.4 **Scouting**: when the site search finds nothing good, code posts "scout" tasks for idle workers in
      different directions (run as written, no model calls) while the mayor draws designs. Test: model-driven run
      from a poor start point.

## Phase 2A: village infrastructure (the user's, 2026-09-29; before 2.3)

The first buildings of every village are a storage hut and a mining hut; storage is sorted and inventoried; the
mayor plans from stock against needs; workers gather several needed materials per trip; mining happens in one mine,
not in holes everywhere, and what it finds goes into the atlas. Decisions (the user's, 09-29): fixed designs in code
for the two huts; the needs list is computed by code (the mayor can add to it); the mine is a staircase from inside
the hut down to stone, then straight branch tunnels at one level.

- [ ] V.1 **Storage hut** and V.2 **sorted storage** (done together; designed 09-29, proposed to the user, to be
      built next session):
      - Storage hut, fixed design in code: 7 wide x 9 deep x 4 high; cobblestone floor, plank walls, log corners, plank
        roof, oak door at the front middle, no windows (no sand needed); inside 5x7 with 9 chest spots, 4 along each
        side wall (x 0 and 4, z 0/2/4/6 of the interior) and 1 at the back middle (2,6), an aisle from the door. No two
        chests orthogonally adjacent (they would join into a double chest). Chest cells are `_` in the design (keep what
        is there), so the hut is built around chests already placed. About 150 blocks, mostly planks.
      - `plan_layout` (`layout.ts`, around the storage task at line ~138) adds the storage hut to a village's first
        layout by itself (the mayor does not name it); order: prepare the plot; set up the storage with the first chest
        in chest spot 1 of the laid-out hut (not beside the plot: `nextChestSpot`/`chestSpotOk` in `mcStorage.ts` refuse
        plots today, so designated spots need an exception); gather for the hut; build it. Gathering for the other
        buildings may start at once (deposits into chest 1); their build tasks wait for the storage hut (the mining hut
        joins that "first buildings" group in V.5).
      - Sorted storage: each chest gets a material group at its first use (logs of any kind, planks, cobblestone, sand,
        glass, ...; leftovers such as doors and coal share a misc chest); `deposit` routes each item to its group's
        chest, a new chest into the next free hut spot when that one is full or missing; `withdraw` goes to the right
        chest. The record reads "chest 1 (logs): 64 oak_log, 12 birch_log; chest 2 (cobblestone): ..." in the village
        summary, `/api/village/:v` and the panel. Cocoa beans go on the junk list (F57). Old villages keep their
        loose chests.
      - Tests: typecheck; staged `--stage build` with the hut (chest ends up inside, hut built around it, mixed deposits
        sorted); staged full run; then a model-driven run.
- [ ] V.2 (see V.1).
- [ ] V.3 **Materials needed**: code computes what the laid-out, unbuilt buildings still need (their bills minus
      storage minus what workers carry) and shows it in every village summary; the mayor can add items
      (`add_need`); gather tasks come from it. Test: the list after each deposit in a staged run.
- [ ] V.4 **Several materials per trip**: a worker gathering X also takes other needed materials it passes (open
      blocks a few steps off its path, up to what is needed). Test: staged full run, trips and time against StageT5.
- [ ] V.5 **Mining hut and mine**: a fixed hut over a staircase down to stone, then branch tunnels at one level;
      `collect` stone, cobblestone and ores goes to the mine and extends the tunnels instead of digging at the
      surface; the tunnels are recorded in the village. Test: staged runs; no surface holes around the village.
- [ ] V.6 **Underground atlas**: ores and stone exposed in tunnel walls (and seen in loaded chunks below the
      surface, if cheap enough) are recorded per chunk and level. Test: a mining run, then the atlas against
      `/api/block`.
- [ ] V.7 Model-driven village runs with all of it.

## Phase 3: humans in the loop (part 2 of the user's goal)

The user asks the mayor in chat ("build me a house by the river", "we need a bigger hall"); the village designs,
lays out, gathers and builds it, and the mayor answers in chat.

- [ ] 3.1 **Talking to the mayor in tests**: an API route that posts a player's message as chat the mayor hears
      (`POST /api/village/:v/say {from, text}`), or a real player message over RCON if one can be made to arrive as
      chat. Keep the 30 s chat limit and keep workers out of it (only the mayor answers players).
- [ ] 3.2 **The mayor hears requests**: player chat naming the mayor or the village wakes its planner (today chat
      only wakes the executor) with the request as a new objective or an addition to the current one.
- [ ] 3.3 **Code places it**: "by the river", "next to the hall", "here" become a site search near a place (atlas:
      water, forest), a building, or the player's position; a second plot when the first is full.
- [ ] 3.4 **Code checks it can be built**: materials within reach (atlas), unobtainable blocks refused, rough time
      estimate from the bill of materials.
- [ ] 3.5 **The mayor answers**: what it will build, where, and roughly how long, in one chat line.
- [ ] 3.6 mayorbench cases for chat requests; then runs with the user in the game.

## Phase 4: speed and scale

- [ ] 4.1 ~~Gathering that finishes trees~~ (moved to 2.2); choose trees by reachable logs (atlas `low` counts).
- [ ] 4.2 The storage chest between the plot and the nearest trees and stone, not wherever the first deposit is.
- [ ] 4.3 More workers where gathering allows (4 workers only paid off with enough trees apart; see F12).
- [ ] 4.4 Executors on gpt-oss (benchmark with `scripts/bench/execbench.mts` first). Low value now: workers make
      few model calls since run-as-written.

## Backlog (not scheduled)

- Stairs and fence collision in the sandbox; a real downloaded schematic; `/save` API route.
- Events carry no timestamp (the panel cannot say "2 min ago").
- Two builders drawing on the chest at once still come up short now and then (the requeue recovers).
- The pathfinder's own dirt pillars and bridges (scaffolding while walking) are left standing; track and remove them
  (felling's server check removes those in a climb column, F57).
- Cocoa beans (and other drops of jungle trees) go into the chest with `deposit item=all`: add them to the junk list
  (27 in Fell1's chest; planned with V.2).
- Narrow the pre-existing Windows firewall rule for Node.js (any TCP, any address) to the local subnet.

## Findings log

What runs showed, with the evidence, and what was done. Newest last. Keep entries short; move durable lessons to
CLAUDE.md when a phase ends.

- F1 (09-28) Builds came up short because gathering pooled wood kinds while builders put each part in one kind. Fix:
  one village wood kind (only when enough grows near the site), parts split across kinds by layers.
- F2 `collect` spent minutes on unreachable blocks (6 tries of up to 2 min each). Fix: 3 tries or 90 s, shared memory
  of unreachable blocks, targets shared between bots.
- F3 `move_to` reported "arrived" when boxed in: the pathfinder's goto can return without arriving. Fix: arrival check.
- F4 A trapped bot was never moved. Fix: `mcRescue.ts` (swim, walk, climb, teleport onto the storage chest).
- F5 The mayor re-posted work when woken on a timer. Fix: no timer once laid out; board status in its prompt. Prompt
  wording alone did not help (mayorbench results vary run to run).
- F6 Smelting stopped before the last item (8 sand gave 7 glass). Fix: wait while the furnace is cooking.
- F7 "Storage is full" with 23 slots free: a failed deposit was reported as full. Fix: retry, honest message.
- F8 Leaf litter and apples filled the chest. Fix: junk list.
- F9 Two builders starting together each chose wood from a record the other was emptying. Fix: re-read the chests
  and choose again before giving up (still happens rarely).
- F10 A pickaxe from mixed plank kinds failed (3 birch + 2 oak planks). Fix: count one kind.
- F11 `collect` counted blocks taken by another bot as unreachable. Fix: shared targets, gone blocks are no failure.
- F12 4 workers were barely faster than 2 on the same trees (a 12-log task took 2.3 min instead of 1.2). Gathering,
  not models, limits speed: see phase 4.
- F13 Executors faked gather tasks (withdrew logs and deposited them again). Fix: code-posted steps run as written;
  executor calls per worker fell from 13-52 to 0-6 per run.
- F14 Gatherers dug stone out of the prepared plot, then builds found the ground uneven. Fix: plots are off limits.
- F15 A build failed four times with everything needed carried: a crafting error was swallowed and the inventory view
  was stale. Fix: error shown in the message; crafting falls back to the server's counts.
- F16 The API stopped answering with 4 bots: pathfinder searches (15 s think time) and 4096-block scans saturated the
  event loop. Fix: 15 ms per tick per bot, filtered block search, watcher retries.
- F17 The mayor, woken with everything built, waited instead of declaring complete. Fix: code declares it.
- F18 Gather tasks for sand where there is none kept buildings waiting for minutes. Fix: fail at once (soft).
- F19 A site smaller than the layout sent the mayor exploring 500 blocks away. Open: step 1.2.
- F21 The mayor draws designs before it knows how much land there is (Fourfold7: designs for a 19x19 layout, land
  17-18 blocks). Step 1.2 gives the architect the site size.
- F22 "Digging aborted" on stone, 5 times in the 4-worker runs and never before: most likely the pathfinder finishing
  its own dig after a walk. Fix in `b7908db` (clear the goal, wait, retry once), not yet seen in a run.
- F23 `explore` reported "no path ... stopped at" the point it had reached: the arrival check compares with a goal
  whose y was estimated. Cosmetic; step 1.4.
- F20 Deposits leave 1-3 items behind "though there is room" (11 times in the 4-worker runs, every worker): the bot's
  inventory view and the server's disagree by a few items. Harmless (the items stay with the worker), but a sign to
  count deposits on the server as building already does. Backlog.

- F24 (09-28, step 1.2) find_site at Fourfold7's spot (-195,-97) now finds 19x19 in 3 s: the old search stepped
  centres by 2 blocks and offered 17x17 three times. Wider searches take 1-4 s (API replies stay under 1 s); forced to
  walk (max_slope 0) it took 2 legs, 74 blocks, 24 s. Tightfit1: partial layout, then the second site found and laid
  out by code within the same minute; the mayor never explored.
- F25 A vague first plan step ("Search for a dry, flat, open area...") made the mayor's executor ask for 11x11, and
  the architect sized to the site's room: 3x3 cottages. Fix (after the run, to be seen in 1.5): the mayor's first
  find_site asks for at least 24, and the brief never goes below 5x5 (what does not fit goes on a second site).
- F26 A worker gathered 135 blocks from the village (collect from -55,70,-54, storage at -189,-48) after repeated
  "stuck" failures on acacia logs on hills (4 of Worker1's 6 failures): workers' explore is not range-guarded. Backlog
  unless it recurs in 1.5.
- F27 The b7908db checks in Tightfit1: "Gave up" an ungatherable sand task at once, seen; the teleport of
  SausageOfDoom4, seen; no "Digging aborted" (5 in the 4-worker runs), consistent with the fix; completion was
  declared by the mayor itself, so the code path was not needed; no stone pickaxe: both pickaxes were crafted by the
  executor at 8-10 min with no cobblestone in hand (not a failure, not yet seen working).
- F28 mayorbench (gpt-oss, 6-10 samples): the new cases "partial layout: find a second site nearby" 6/6 and "refused,
  site too small: find_site bigger" 6/6; "second site found: plan_layout the rest" 2/6 and 1/10 (it took the second
  site as too small for everything), hence done in code. Old cases on the committed prompt vs the new one: first plan
  6/6 vs 7/10, requeued-wait 4/6 vs 6/10, layout-under-way 0/6 vs 1/6, failed-hard 0/6 vs 0/6: noise, and the last
  two are handled by code guards.
- F29 (step 1.3) Fourfold7's 3-minute mayor start: its first plan (at spawn) was an empty wait, accepted without a
  log line; the stall review ("no step has been completed for 3 minutes") was the first thing to wake it. Fixed as in
  1.3; Accept1's mayor planned at 0.1 min.
- F30 Accept1 (the F25 fix): "find_site size raised to 24" was seen, designs came out 5x5 and 7x7. find_site's
  level-ground pass (height range 2) chose a 30x30 in the forest (1057 tree blocks) over open ground with range 4;
  prepare_site felled 13 trees in 2.4 min and the logs fed the builds, so this is fine in woods. The watcher did not
  teleport SausageOfDoom4, who was offline (correct).
- F31 "Declared complete by code" seen working (Accept1, the mayor waited with everything built).
- F32 Accept2: both designs had a furnace as decoration ("a furnace for interior light"). The hall's build crafted one
  and placed it, and its 4 glass windows stayed open (142 of 146 blocks), most likely for want of a furnace to smelt
  the sand gathered for them. The watcher cuts event text at ~300 characters, so the exact reason is not in the log
  (F35).
- F33 Accept3: the architect drew the hall in sandstone in a jungle; all three sandstone tasks (81 blocks) were given
  up at once ("no sandstone within 96 blocks": the F18 fix working), leaving the hall short. Designs need materials
  that exist near the site: see the handover.
- F34 find_site's "taken" ground is its own village's buildings, layouts and reservations; other villages' buildings
  only count against a site as built-on ground. Accept2 started 100 blocks from Accept1 and was fine, but a new village
  could be laid out over an old one.
- F35 The watch script truncates event text (~300 characters), hiding the end of long failure messages. Print them
  in full, or write the full events to a second file.
- F36 (session 3) Fixes for F32-F35, tested without models (`runs/2026-09-28/s3-materials.log`): plan_layout asks the
  world (`WorldAdapter.materialsNear`, the blocks `collect` would look for, within 96 blocks of the site) for every
  material a design's gather tasks name, sand excepted, and refuses the design when one is missing: Fourfold7's
  sandstone cottage was refused at Accept3's jungle site and laid out in the badlands. The architect's brief says when
  the site has no sandstone or sand. Survival designs may not use furnaces, crafting tables, chests and the like as
  decoration (Fourfold7's cottage had a chest and a table; checked in code, one retry; not yet seen in a run).
  find_site keeps off every village's buildings, layouts and other villages' plots: Gus in the middle of Accept1's
  plot got a site 45 blocks away. The watcher prints failures and finished builds in full.
- F37 (Accept4) The agent server stopped answering for 30+ s at ~16 min and Paper disconnected all three bots at
  once ("Timed out"); the workers never recovered. Memory was fine (255 MB). Cause unknown: the agent server now logs
  every event-loop stall over 2 s with each agent's running action (`[lag]` lines). Seen since: 2-3.5 s at spawn
  (three bots joining) and during find_site's log scan (up to ~2 s; the API's slowest reply 2.1 s), none long.
- F38 (Accept4-5) A mayor plan step "plan_layout" went to the executor, which cannot call it and ran find_site
  instead, replacing a 30x30 site with a 24x24 one. Fixed: such steps are dropped and the planner calls the tool; a
  later search before any layout asks for no less than the site already found.
- F39 (Accept5) Designs of 11x11 and 13x13 (~1,100 blocks for the village) with mossy cobblestone: moss comes from
  lush caves, workers went to y=-4. Fixed: survival designs at most 9x9; raw materials whitelisted (logs, stone,
  sand, sandstone, dirt, gravel, terracotta): of 97 stored designs only the 10 needing moss, iron, glowstone, wool,
  sugar cane, leather or clay are refused.
- F40 (Accept6) The executor model ran at 2.7 tok/s, one turn 187 s: Ollama reported it "20383 of 20383 MB in VRAM"
  while nvidia-smi showed 1.3 GB on its card (Windows shared GPU memory counted as VRAM). `ollama_exec.py` now checks
  each card holds its model (start and status). Probably slowed Accept4-5 too.
- F41 (Accept7) Wood buried deep (y=34 under a desert at y=70) counted as wood near the site in find_site and the
  materials check. Fixed: only blocks within 16 of the ground count; a site without trees makes find_site walk toward
  trees and plan_layout refuse ("run find_site for a site with trees"); the watcher skips treeless land.
- F42 (Accept8) The site had 1 log block within 48: a survival site now needs 30 (find_site walks toward trees and
  prefers a smaller wooded site to a bigger bare one: from Accept8's spot it walked 52 blocks to a 25x25 with 38);
  collect keeps within 16 blocks below the village and off a plot's 2-block margin (an 18-deep hole appeared there).
- F43 (Accept9) One glass short: "could not smelt 2 glass (ran out of fuel after 1 of 2)". The fuel in the bill runs
  short by a little; backlog.
- F43 fixed: smelting loaded only the first plank stack as fuel (a leftover of one or two planks) and gave up with
  more in hand; it now tops up from the furnace window's slots (the bot's own inventory view lagged and offered the
  plank already burning). Tested: 4 sand with fuel split 1 + 5 planks gave 4 glass; Accept11's windows all glazed.
- F45 (Accept12) The material check passed a village needing 247 sandstone after finding one block, and counted
  sandstone buried under sand that collect never goes for. It now counts up to the amount needed, as collect can
  get it (near the surface; anything within 40 blocks of the site, only exposed blocks beyond).
- F46 (Accept12) A queued sandstone collect left over from a given-up task failed again under each newly claimed log
  task and gave three of them up. Only the held task whose material failed is given up, and the queue goes with it.
- F47 (Accept13) 115 of 131 logs was refused, find_site returned the same site, the mayor circled and finally drew a
  cottage named "two_cottages_and_hall". Wood may now be a quarter short (felled trees on the plot, unloaded ground),
  and the refusal offers smaller buildings as well as another site.
- F48 (Accept14) After failed log collects a worker's executor explored hop by hop to 180 blocks from the village
  (F26 again), then gave up every gathering task it took. The 96-block guard covers every village member, a collect
  far from home walks back first, and the failure message no longer suggests exploring.
- F49 (Accept16) All three buildings stood at 37.6 min, but the mayor had just tried to re-post gathering (dropped as
  duplicates), so the completion check after its "wait" never ran and nothing woke it. Completion is now checked by
  code on every tick of the mayor's brain; Accept18 was declared complete this way.
- F50 (Accept17) The watcher spawned the village at its probe point, 100 blocks from the site found, where the mayor
  was stuck in a hollow: its explore and move_to timed out there, the rescue ignored timed-out walks, and its design
  steps waited behind the walk until the run stalled. The watcher now spawns at the site; a timed-out walk that got
  nowhere counts as stuck.
- F51 Log roofs ("oak log roof", 81 logs for a 9x9 hall) make villages wood-heavy: Accept16 and 18 took 38-39 min.
  A cap on logs per design, or a hint to the architect, would help; backlog.
- F52 The workers' planner made no calls in any acceptance run (`plan 0x0ms` for every worker): tasks posted by code
  run as written, and the executor handles failures. Comparing planner models on these runs measures nothing; phase
  3 (chat requests) is where the workers' planner will matter.
- F53 (09-29, step 2.1) The atlas scan reads block state ids from the chunk column through a per-state lookup table,
  from the highest non-empty section down: 0.085 ms a chunk (99th percentile 0.14) in `scripts/bench/atlasbench.mts`
  on jungle-edge chunks, against 6.4-11.8 ms a chunk the `bot.blockAt` way (`surfaceAt` in find_site): ~80x. In the
  agent server: 329 chunks within 10 s of Gus spawning, median 0.1 ms, p99 0.6, max 1.0 (early, JIT warm-up); no
  `[lag]` lines. `scripts/checks/atlas.py` matched 12 chunks column by column against `/api/block` (oak woods, the
  lake at -235,-53: water, logs high and low, stone, gravel), after fixing the check's own rounding. "Other" ground
  is almost always built (Accept9's cottage); cocoa pods counted as ground, now passed over. 700 chunks are 158 KB
  on disk (~225 bytes each). find_site's `surfaceAt` could use the same reading (2.3).
- F54 (09-29) What collect failures were in Accept1-18 (103): 61 "could not reach" logs, of which 39 had the bot
  standing right under the target 5-9 blocks up (a trunk left floating after its lower logs were cut; the unreachable
  memory is per block, so each log of one trunk failed again: -571,-195 and -571,-220 in Accept15 over and over); 22
  unclear (the log keeps the last of three problems). All 13 "no logs within 96 blocks" came from Accept7, 8 and 14,
  whose causes are fixed. With view distance 8 (~128 blocks) a worker near home has the whole 96-block range loaded,
  so an atlas-guided collect would rarely find anything the local search misses.
- F55 (09-29, step 2.2) Felling tests with Gus (`scripts/checks/fell_trees.py`, `runs/2026-09-29/trees-check*.log`):
  in oak and birch woods (-380,20 and -400,45) about 24 trees came down, all but one with nothing left, 88 logs cut and 84 in hand
  (server count), climbs of 2-3 on tall birches, and the climbs' dirt came back. Found and fixed on the way: climbing
  for logs off to the side (a second trunk joined by a branch: now cut from the ground first, climbs only for logs
  above reach), drops lost (24 of 54 kept: a 20 s sweep within 8 blocks instead of 6 s within 4), a refused
  placement (retried once), a climb started 4 blocks below the foot (climbs only beside the trunk), pillar bottoms
  left or wrongly reported left (the bot's view lags placing and digging: the server is asked after the sweep and
  leftovers broken by command). **And Gus, in no village, felled about 101 jungle logs from Accept15's cottages
  and hall** (their log frames and log roofs read as trees): `collect` kept off only its own village's buildings,
  which let any agent take another village's logs one by one before, and whole frames with felling. Fixed: collect
  keeps off every village's buildings and plots, and a tree must have leaves on its logs (protects unrecorded log
  builds too). The logs were restored by command (the user agreed; each design's log cells that were air).
- F56 (09-29, step 2.2) On 26.1 the placer is often not sent the block update for its own placement: Mineflayer
  reports "the block is still air" (and its physics stands on nothing) when the server placed the dirt, and a retry
  put a second block on top. Pillar placements now ask the server (`execute if block`) and write the block into the
  bot's view. After each felling the climb column is checked on the server and leftovers are broken by command
  (`setblock ... air destroy`); a bot that dug dirt beside the tree walks back to the foot before climbing (it climbed
  from one of its holes, and the check then broke the refilled hole: 5 holes, filled by hand). Whole trees cost time:
  StageT2 18.0 min against StageW2's 11.1 for the same buildings, mostly the drop sweep walking after saplings; with
  logs and dirt only, StageT5 13.0 min. Whole trees also gather surplus (43 logs left in StageT2's storage).
- F57 (09-29, Fell1) Pillar placements refused with the bot's feet at 75.42-76.50 over a block at 75-76: a jump
  needs two free blocks over the head (feet + 2 and + 3), and a leaf or log at + 3 capped it. The climb now clears
  leaves and the tree's logs at both, and does not place until the feet are above the block. The 2 pillar blocks
  once left with no climb recorded were most likely the pathfinder's own scaffolding while sweeping drops (backlog:
  the pathfinder's pillars); the server check removed them. Deposits carry cocoa beans (27 in Fell1's chest): add
  them to the junk list (backlog). A first placement try is still refused now and then with the feet above the block
  (the server's copy of the bot's position is a tick behind); the retry places it (trees-check9: climbs of 4-5 with
  nothing left).
- F44 The materials check and find_site's log scan run synchronously (2-2.7 s stalls with agents idle, at layout
  and during the land probe). Harmless so far; make them incremental if stalls grow.

## Decisions log

- 09-28 One wood kind per village, when enough of it grows near the site (user agreed).
- 09-28 Scaling test with 4 workers (Worker3, Worker4); the standard stays 2 workers.
- 09-28 Code-posted task steps run without the executor; the model handles only what follows a failure.
- 09-28 The Paper server listens on the LAN with a whitelist; the panel on the LAN via `MC_API_HOST=0.0.0.0`.
- 09-28 Shared atlas (phase 2) comes after the phase 1 acceptance runs and before the chat requests (phase 3 needs
  it for "by the river").
- 09-28 The panel opens in simple mode by default (detailed one click away, remembered per browser).
- 09-28 Time frozen at day (`advance_time false`); random ticks (growth) and animals are unaffected as far as known
  (not tested in 26.1: offer to check a sapling grows if it matters).
- 09-28 The watch scripts teleport the watching player (MCAI_PLAYER, default SausageOfDoom4) to the Mayor, Worker1
  (staged) or the test agent.
- 09-28 A partial layout goes ahead when at least half the buildings fit (the workers start at once); fewer is
  refused in favour of a bigger site. The rest is laid out by code at the mayor's next successful find_site.
- 09-28 (session 3) Survival designs are at most 9x9 and use only whitelisted raw materials; a survival site
  needs 30 log blocks within 48; material and wood counts ignore anything more than 16 below ground level.
- 09-29 Step 1.5 counted as passed (the user), and the branch pushed.
- 09-29 Every village member stays within 96 blocks of its village (the guard covered only the mayor before
  Accept14).
- 09-29 The atlas is one shared map for every agent and village (the user's choice over per-village knowledge), kept
  in its own file (`mc/server/atlas.json`, saved at most every 30 s) rather than `villages.json`, which is written on
  every change and returned whole by `/api/village/:v`.
- 09-29 New phase 2A, village infrastructure (the user's requirements): storage hut with 9 chests, sorted storage
  and a readable inventory, a code-computed materials-needed list the mayor plans from and can add to, several
  materials per trip, a mining hut with a staircase mine, underground finds in the atlas. It comes before 2.3.
  Fixed designs in code for both huts; mine = staircase then branch tunnels (the user's choices).
- 09-29 Step 2.2 becomes "finish trees" with pillar removal (the user's choice, after F54); the atlas-guided collect
  moves to 2.2b.
- 09-29 Phase 1 closed with step 1.6 (README and ARCHITECTURE.md brought up to date); phase 2 starts with 2.1.
- 09-28 The mayor stays within 96 blocks of its village (the same range as gathering); find_site walks at most two
  40-block legs itself instead.

## Keeping this plan honest

- **When a run shows something new**, add a finding with evidence (log line, numbers). Then decide: fix now if it
  blocks the current step; otherwise add it to the right phase or the backlog, and say why.
- **When a finding invalidates a step** (wrong cause, better approach), edit the step and add a decision explaining
  the change. Do not silently delete: strike through (`~~...~~`) and point to the replacement.
- **Acceptance criteria are concrete** (what run, what counts as passing). If one turns out to be wrong, change it in
  the decisions log, not quietly.
- Keep the "Next session starts with" section current at the end of every session, including uncommitted work and
  anything left running.
